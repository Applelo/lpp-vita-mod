Lua Player Plus MOD for PSVITA

Doesn't work with HENKaku, go to see the new amazing [LPP Vita](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-vita) :) 

All Lua Player Plus Vita functions are detailed in the [Wiki] (https://github.com/Applelo/lpp-vita-mod/wiki)

Works thanks to :
* [Lua Player Plus Source](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-vita) by **Rinnegatamante**
* [Vita2DLib](https://github.com/xerpi/vita2dlib) & [FTPVita](https://github.com/xerpi/ftpvitalib) by **xerpi**
* [VitaSDK](https://github.com/vitasdk) by a lot of Vita Dev
